Here is some useful and detailed scripts I have written. I am a Postgraduate student in Huazhong University of Science and Technology. I do not consider myself as a programmer.

Because of the orientation in my research subject, I have to learn the Software Defined Network(SDN), RYU(the controller of SDN) and the Python and the Mininet(simulate the SDN network). Therefore, I hope this project in the github can record my learning process and progress. In the github, I will establish four projects, they are mininet, Ryu, python and APP-SDN repectively. This project is python which is aimed at completing some important or interesting tasks by Python.

I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at jianghaiqi@hust.edu.cn.
